## Application Overview
Run the World is a milage tracking app that allows a user to log their run milage and then deduct it from the total circumference of the Earth to let them know how many more miles they have to complete until they've Run the World.  
Run the World although originally designed for runners, can also be used to track milage of any activity, including cycling, rowing, walking, hiking, or any other activity where you can track milage.

This was an idea that started when I was training for marathons, and became curious as to how many miles in relation to other distances I had run.  I thought it would be interesting to keep a log of how many more miles it would take to reach certain distances, inculding other cities, countries or even the world.
